* Use SIFT in OpenCV for image matching via OpenCV. Take a look at the results.
* This is a bonus assignment. You can decide whether to complete this assignment.

## Requirement

* python <= 3.6. If you have already updated your python to some version above, consider downgrade or virtual env like anaconda.
* opencv-python == 3.4.2.16. Later releases remove the non-free modules like SIFT. see [issue #270](https://github.com/opencv/opencv-python/issues/270)
* opencv-contrib-python == 3.4.2.16 corresponding to the version of opencv-python.

## Get started
* Run  `python sift.py` to see results.
